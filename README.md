## 🎯 Project Goal

This project analyzes how AI may impact different job roles across industries. Instead of fueling fear, the focus is on understanding risk, spotting resilience, and imagining how roles might evolve—not vanish.

Inspired by the **Thomson Reuters 2024 Future of Professionals Report**, the dataset and code help us explore:
- What job traits increase automation risk?
- Which jobs are most vulnerable?
- What makes a job “AI-proof”?

---

## 🧠 Dataset Overview

> ✅ Simulated but based on real-world trends  
> ✅ Dimensions include routine %, creativity, human interaction, emotional intelligence, org AI investment, etc.  
> ✅ Risk score calculated using weighted traits

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- Routine-heavy jobs face higher risk.
- Emotional intelligence and creativity = lower risk.
- Some jobs may disappear, but many will **transform** (e.g., Recruiter → People Analyst).
